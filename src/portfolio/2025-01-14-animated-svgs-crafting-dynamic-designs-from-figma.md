For this assignment, I created animated SVGs using a Figma design. I downloaded a digital file from https://undraw.co/, an SVG file that works with Figma. The project took several hours to complete, blending challenges with moments of creativity. Editing SVG images felt like coloring pictures, which I enjoyed, just like I did when I was young.

Attending the Figma for Education Monthly Workshop via Zoom last Friday was a significant learning milestone. The invitation sent to my school email made joining effortless, and the workshop provided an excellent introduction to Figma's features and capabilities. It helped me feel more comfortable navigating the platform and applying its tools effectively to this assignment.

I also enhanced my understanding by learning from various online tutorials, including:

* [How to design and create SVGs in Figma vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_l3Yof7Deg): This tutorial provides foundational knowledge about creating precise and scalable vector graphics in Figma. It covers essential tools and tips for organizing layers and exporting designs as SVGs.
* [Awesome SVG animation using pure CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrsJbz-Wp8U): This resource demonstrated how to create smooth animations using only CSS, focusing on transitions, keyframes, and hover effects for interactive designs.
* [Learn To Build An SVG Animation With CSS](<>) by developedbyed: This video guided me through creating engaging SVG animations with CSS, emphasizing techniques like stroke-dasharray, stroke-dashoffset, and animation timing for dynamic visual effects.

These resources provided valuable insights into designing and animating SVGs effectively, equipping me with practical techniques to apply to my project.

Making animations for images was not that easy, and it was complicated by errors that resulted in unexpected matters. Technical tips became undone. After all, though coming back to the tutorials was sometimes annoying, I found it made my learning experience better in the end. The problems I encountered in this case helped me develop my animation techniques and problem-solving skills. I can honestly say that being given guidance, like showing me some visual examples that are simple and easy to understand and some solutions, would help me to improve further. Even in the face of all these issues, I have enjoyed the project and built my design skills. This task showed me the value of never giving up and gaining knowledge by trying and making mistakes.\
