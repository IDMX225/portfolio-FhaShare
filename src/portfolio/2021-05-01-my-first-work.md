title: Pome Sites
description: This poem is from one of Sunthorn Phu (The William Shakespeare of
  Thailand)â€™s most renowned works, the epic of Phra Aphai Mani. The particular
  chapter from which this poem is drawn follows the story of Sudsakorn, who had
  been fooled and his magical items were stolen. His mentor, a hermit, magically
  appears and rescues him, then teaches him not to easily trust others.

For my first poem site in the IDMX 268 Web Page Development II class, I decided to feature a Thai poem and adjust the design colors to match its mood and tone. I aimed for a subtle yet harmonious palette that complements the traditional feel of the poem to create a visually immersive experience.

For the other poem site, I chose the pumpkin's pome to reflect the fall season and my personal approach to connecting design elements with content themes. The pumpkin article not only aligns with the autumn period but also adds warmth and vibrancy to the overall visual presentation.

Through these adjustments and design decisions, I've gained a deeper understanding of balancing creativity with functionality in web design. Every choice in layout, color, and structure adds to the user's experience, and each project teaches me something new.
