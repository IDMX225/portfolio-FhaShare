title: Pome Sites
description: In this blog post, I will share my design journey through two poem
  websites I developed for my IDMX 268 Web Page Development II class. One site
  features a traditional Thai poem, and I focused on creating a subtle,
  harmonious color palette to match the poem's mood. The other side celebrates
  the fall season with a pumpkin-themed poem, connecting seasonal elements with
  vibrant design choices. I will discuss how I balanced creativity and
  functionality to create immersive user experiences in both projects.

For my first poem site in the IDMX 268 Web Page Development II class, I decided to feature a Thai poem and adjust the design colors to match its mood and tone. I aimed for a subtle yet harmonious palette that complements the traditional feel of the poem to create a visually immersive experience.

For the other poem site, I chose the pumpkin's pome to reflect the fall season and my personal approach to connecting design elements with content themes. The pumpkin article not only aligns with the autumn period but also adds warmth and vibrancy to the overall visual presentation.

Through these adjustments and design decisions, I've gained a deeper understanding of balancing creativity with functionality in web design. Every choice in layout, color, and structure adds to the user's experience, and each project teaches me something new.
