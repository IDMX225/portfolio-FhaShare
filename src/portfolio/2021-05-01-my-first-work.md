## Phra Aphai Mani — Sudsakorn

### By Sunthorn Phu

### Translated by Ken Mathis Lohatepanont

This poem is from one of Sunthorn Phu (The William Shakespeare of Thailand)’s most renowned works, the epic of Phra Aphai Mani. The particular chapter from which this poem is drawn follows the story of Sudsakorn, who had been fooled and his magical items were stolen. His mentor, a hermit, magically appears and rescues him, then teaches him not to easily trust others, comparing the human mind to entangled vines. The hermit concludes by saying that self-reliance and knowing how to survive is the best of all traits. This particular selection from Phra Aphai Mani is a beloved classic and one of the most well known poems in Thailand.

* ### P﻿ome Meaning

Do not trust others, he said:\
be afraid of the human mind.

Even the most twisted of vines\
seems benign compared to the soul.

Two people do have pure intent:\
Your parents, who love with hearts whole.

But destiny’s yours to control\
It’s your role to think on your own.

Beware of even the friendly\
Cautiously think through all you’ve known.

Knowledge is not enough, alone:\
The capstone is learning to survive.
