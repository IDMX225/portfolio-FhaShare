title: Applying Color in UI Design on CodePen
description: In this blog post, I will share my experience designing a product
  card inspired by the fall season. I used a pumpkin emoji for a fictional
  business named "Spooky Jack's Pumpkin" and followed George Francis's tutorial
  to explore the power of HSL and CSS custom properties. I will explain my
  grayscale-to-color process and share insights into how I used color theory to
  enhance the design and capture the festive spirit of fall.

Recently, I worked on a project following George Francis's tutorial on applying color in UI design using HSL and CSS custom properties. My task was to design a product card, and I chose a pumpkin emoji inspired by the fall season for a fictional business called "Spooky Jack's Pumpkin. "

Grayscale and Color Exploration
I started with a grayscale version to ensure the layout and contrast were solid before adding color. After that, I experimented with HSL values to create a vibrant, fall-themed color scheme. I used a color playpen to fine-tune the palette.

Final Product Card
With the colors finalized, I applied them to the product card, ensuring it was visually appealing and accessible with proper contrast.

This project taught me how to effectively use HSL colors and custom properties in CSS while considering accessibility. It was a great way to dive deeper into color in UI design!

In October, the pumpkin is a symbol of happiness!
