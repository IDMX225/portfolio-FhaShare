title: Exploring Variable Fonts
description: In this blog post, I share my experience working with the Fraunces
  variable font. I explore the unique customization options it offers, such as
  adjusting weight, optical size, softness, and wonkiness, all within the CSS
  framework. Through self-hosting the font and deploying the project on Netlify,
  I gained valuable insights into the power of variable fonts in web design.
  This post is perfect for anyone interested in learning how variable fonts can
  enhance both the functionality and aesthetics of typography on the web.

I recently worked on a project where I delved into the Fraunces variable font and experimented with its unique axes, such as weight, optical size, softness, and wonk. Variable fonts provide more flexibility than traditional fonts, allowing designers to dynamically adjust multiple aspects of typography using CSS.

To begin, I opted to self-host the Fraunces font files instead of using Google Fonts, and I used the @font-face rule to link them directly from the project files. This approach gave me greater control over the font's behavior and allowed me to explore its customization.

Using Firefox's DevTools, I made adjustments to different font axes, fine-tuning the header and paragraph styles for weight, optical size, softness, and wonkiness. Each adjustment resulted in a different look, demonstrating the versatility of variable fonts.

Finally, I deployed the project to Netlify, ensuring that the Fraunces font loaded locally, and confirmed its presence using Firefox's Fonts panel. 

This experience deepened my understanding of typography, particularly the flexibility and control that variable fonts offer. I'm looking forward to incorporating more of these techniques into future projects!
